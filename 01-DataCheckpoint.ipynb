Through our background research, we found a study published in the American Journal of Police indicating that there were significantly higher property crime rates yet lower crime rates in the university area compared to the cities/county due to college students being easier targets, and the findings were consistent with other studies such as from University of South Florida. Our null hypothesis is there is no significant difference in the aforementioned above and our alternative hypothesis is that there is a significant difference in the aforementioned above.\n"

    "### Describing the important metrics:\n",
    "This dataset comes from the FBI’s NIBRS incident-based reporting for California in 2024. After joining the offense table with offense type and joining incidents to agencies/counties, each offense record can be counted and summarized by county. Our important metrics are: offense_rows, offense_name and the offense_category_name it fits into like Aggrevated assult would be categorized as a violent crime, and offences_per_100k.\n",
    "\n",
    "offense_rows: The total number of reported offense records in a county for a given offense type. This represents the crimes reported to law enforcement agencies in each county. For example, if Los Angeles has 5,000 theft offenses, that means 5,000 separate theft incidents were officially recorded by law enforcement agencies in that county during 2024.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Major Concerns:\n",
    "There are a few notable concerns that arise from the dataset. Firstly, not all law enforcement agencies report to NIBRS, with the five most populated states (including California) having a combined participation rate of 48% ([Congress.gov](www.congress.gov/crs-product/IF13087)). This combined with many college campuses having their own police forces can lead to underreporting and some student crimes not making any appearances in the county-level data, lowering college town crime rates. Contrastingly, some crimes may be double reported to both the county-level police and campus police. Additionally, there may be behavioral differences in the reporting of college students as compared to permanent residents. Students may be less likely to report certain smaller property crimes than a permanent resident who has more at stake to NOT report. Students may also be discouraged by the tedious process and therefore would fail to report. Next, police presence may vary from town to town, with college towns often having higher presence, leading to higher detection. Furthermore, there are some geographical concerns. Different agencies through the state may classify similar crimes differently, changing the proportion of certain crimes to others. Also, differentiating the boundaries of a college town can be tricky, students live both on campus and around which can create a haziness between resident and student. Lastly, the data coming in annual reports poses the challenge of student population fluctuation, the crime rates and populations could be vastly different during school season as opposed to breaks like summer and winter. \n",

    "### IPEDS Dataset #1 (Enrollment Information) \n",
    "\n",
    "The EF2023-2024 dataset is from IPEDS (Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System) enrollment survey for Fall 2023. Each row represents a single instution identifiable by a unique UNITID. The columns EFLEVEL contains two digit codes representing enrollment categories for that row. For example, a value of 10 represents total enrollment across all levels of students, 20 represents total undergraduate enrollment, and 50 represents total graduate enrollment. These three enrollment categories will likely be the primary focus of our analysis. The main variable of interest is EFTOTAL, which represents the number of enrolled students for the specified category at each institution. This will serve as a proxy for institution size.\n",
    "\n",
    "One limitation is this datasets timing. The surey was conducted at the beginning of the 2023-2024 school year, meaning that it does not represent a full year's average. Because some of our other datasets reprepsent conditions from 2024, there is a slight misalignment in timing. Additionaly, this dataset doesn't account for students dropping out, transferring, or unenrolling later in the year. Essentially theres a very rare chance instutitonal shutdown or enrollment shifts could fruther lter the student population. Thus, the accuracy when correlating enrollment with variables such as crime rates or regional population might be impacted. Additionally, enrollment data is self-reported by institutions, and differences in how schools classify full-time and part-time students could introduce further inconsistencies. Finally, the dataset only includes institutions that participate in IPEDS surveys, meaning some  institutions may be omitted.\n",
    "\n",
    "### IPEDS Dataset #2 (Instution Metadata)\n",
    "\n",
    "The HD2023–2024 dataset is from IPEDS (Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System) and contains institutional level metadata for the 2023–2024 academic school year. Each row represents a single postsecondary institution and is uniquely identified by a UNITID. Key variables include INSTNM (institution name), ADDR (street address), CITY, STABBR (state abbreviation), and ZIP (postal code). These variables describe where each institution is located and allow for geographic grouping or regional analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset will be used in conjunction with the EF2023–2024 enrollment dataset. By merging both datasets on the shared UNITID variable, we can combine institutional metadata with enrollment counts. This allows enrollment size (from EF2023–2024) to be linked with institutional locational characteristcs. We will likely analyze with different enrollment sizes assocaited with its zip code or city region.\n",
    "\n",
    "One limitation of the HD2023–2024 dataset is that it represents institutional characteristics at a specific point in time during the 2023–2024 academic year. Institutional attributes may change over time (for example, a school closing, merging, or changing classification), and these updates may not immediately reflect broader structural shifts. Additionally, as with other IPEDS data, the information is self-reported by institutions, which may introduce minor inconsistencies in how classifications are recorded. Finally, because IPEDS includes only institutions that participate in federal reporting, certain non-participating or very small institutions may be excluded. Despite these limitations, the dataset provides comprehensive institutional-level metadata that is essential for linking enrollment data to meaningful contextual variables.\n",
