    "Crime in college and university towns has been widely reported for the last few decades, with government reported statistics going back to the 1990s. The <a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1) Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act requires that crime data for universities must be publicly reported through a Department of Education sponsored survey. There is an abundance of data on isolated college crimes, but less so on the crime rates of areas near universities. <a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2)A study in the American Journal of Police compared campus and city crime rates, published in 1995 by Max L. Bromley from the University of South Florida, examined the relationship between the crime rates with the local communities that surround the university campus. The data used in the study relied heavily on the two largest universities in each state and on an average of 2 years for the population. In result, there was a similar widespread variation found when comparing the violent and property crime rates per 1,000 students or city residents. All of the comparisons concluded that the university's crime rates were significantly lower than those of their cities. In addition, there was a finding that property crime was the vast majority of crimes compared to violent crimes, and that the university property crimes were especially higher than those in their cities. Overall, the findings were consistent with the prior studies in the 1980s and the early 1990s. <a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note-3)A research paper published on November 24 2020 by Kelsey Cundiff at University of Missouri-St. Louis analyzed campus proximity and neighborhood crime rates. It hypothesized with opportunity theory that neighborhoods within close proximity to college campuses will have higher crime rates because “college students are vulnerable to victimisation\" due to convergence for their social lifestyles. It used data collected by the National Neighborhood Crime Survey, and analysis was done with a “multilevel negative binomial regression” to analyze the relationship between “proximity… to college campus[es] and rates of violent and property crime”. The researchers doing this study found that “bordering tracts higher rates of larceny, burglary, and robbery,” acting as proxies for “indicators of crime.” <a name=\"cite_ref-4\"></a>[<sup>4</sup>](#cite_note-4) A research study published on October 10, 2023 by Carter Prentice and his team conducted a study on whether there was a difference in homicide and suicide rates between college towns/cities vs non college towns. Prentice’s team conducted this study by analyzing county level mortality rates from the CDC death certificate data from the years 2015 to 2019. To determine if a county was deemed a college town they used the classifications of the American Communities Project (ACP) to determine whether it was a college town or not. In college towns, they found that there was a median 2.56 total homicides per 100000 population and in non college towns, a 3.11 total homicide median. But in college towns, they found that people aged less than 24 had a higher rate of firearm homicide compared to non college towns, showing elevated risk in younger people with firearms. The researchers found that the results for population level homicide were not significantly different from college towns and non college towns. They found that certain age groups had increased risk of homicide with no outliers in any counties.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are still notable gaps in the existing research, since studies focus on the close proximity of crime near colleges, or on certain categories of crime(either property or violent crime). Additionally, these studies are fairly old, with the 2020 study at the University of Missouri St. Louis being the most recent to analyse campus proximity in relation to crime.  Additionally, the study conducted in 1995 was conducted for the South Florida region, so we hope to investigate the findings in a different region (California). \n",

    "We predict that there will be a significant difference between the yearly crime rates in the college cities/town and their local county, especially within property crimes rates, such as burglary and robbery. Yearly crime rates are inclusive of all categories (property, violent), violent crime includes offenses such as assault, homicide, and property crime includes offenses such as burglary and robbery. Through our background research, we found a study published in the American Journal of Police indicating that there were significantly higher property crime rates,  yet lower overall crime rates in the university area compared to the cities/county due to college students being easier targets, and the findings were consistent with other studies such as from University of South Florida. Our null hypothesis is there is no significant difference in the aforementioned above and our alternative hypothesis is that there is a significant difference in the aforementioned above."

    "This dataset is from the U.S. Census Bureau's Population Estimates Program and it contains annual resident population estimates for all incorporated places in California, including cities, towns and counties with the shape of (1077, 16). The data spans from April 1, 2020 to July 1, 2024, using the 2020 Decennial Census as a baseline and updating each year using administrative records such as births, deaths, and migration patterns. The 16 columns include geographic identifier codes (SUMLEV, STATE, COUNTY, PLACE, COUSUB, CONCIT), administrative flags (PRIMGEO_FLAG, FUNCSTAT), name fields (NAME, STNAME), and population estimates for each year from 2020 to 2024 plus the 2020 census base (ESTIMATESBASE2020, POPESTIMATE2020 through POPESTIMATE2024). For this study, we want to utilize only the population from 2024 so the other population estimates won't be relevant to keep. In addition, we want the columns that identifies the place as a county and which county it is so we dropped the other columns except for SUMLEV, COUNTY, and the name of the area.\n",

    "#### Concerns\n",
    "One major concern is that the total population number isn't the actual count and just estimates based off of the other variables collected. This is a concern because there will be some error in the numbers and as the years go on, the inaccuracy accumulates. However, this would be even more problematic for smaller counties since a small error can contribute to a larger percentage difference from the true count of population. Additionally, the raw file includes more than just counties such as the first row includes the total population in California and some other rows are cities and towns. So we have to be careful when analyzing the data and filter out the rows we do not need when answering, comparing, or visualizing specific questions. Failing to do so could result in double-counting populations and producing misleading results in any analysis or visualization."

    "### Describing the important metrics:\n",
    "This dataset comes from the FBI’s NIBRS incident-based reporting for California in 2024. After joining the offense table with offense type and joining incidents to agencies/counties, each offense record can be counted and summarized by county. Our important metrics are: offense_rows, offense_name and the offense_category_name it fits into like Aggrevated assult would be categorized as a violent crime, and offences_per_100k.\n",
    "\n",
    "offense_rows: The total number of reported offense records in a county for a given offense type. This represents the crimes reported to law enforcement agencies in each county. For example, if Los Angeles has 5,000 theft offenses, that means 5,000 separate theft incidents were officially recorded by law enforcement agencies in that county during 2024.\n",
    "\n",
    "offenses_per_100k: This metric helps standarde the offense counts per 100,000 residents using county population data. The rate per 100,000 helps compare counties of different sizes more fairly than raw counts. For instance, a small county with 50,000 people reporting 100 burglaries has a rate of 200 per 100k, which can be directly compared to a large county with 1 million people reporting 3,000 burglaries, so 300 per 100k.\n",
    "\n",
    "offense_name and offense_category_name: These classify crimes into specific types and broader categories like \"Violent Crimes\".\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Major Concerns:\n",
    "There are a few notable concerns that arise from the dataset. Firstly, not all law enforcement agencies report to NIBRS, with the five most populated states (including California) having a combined participation rate of 48% ([Congress.gov](www.congress.gov/crs-product/IF13087)). This combined with many college campuses having their own police forces can lead to underreporting and some student crimes not making any appearances in the county-level data, lowering college town crime rates. Contrastingly, some crimes may be double reported to both the county-level police and campus police. Additionally, there may be behavioral differences in the reporting of college students as compared to permanent residents. Students may be less likely to report certain smaller property crimes than a permanent resident who has more at stake to NOT report. Students may also be discouraged by the tedious process and therefore would fail to report. Next, police presence may vary from town to town, with college towns often having higher presence, leading to higher detection. Furthermore, there are some geographical concerns. Different agencies through the state may classify similar crimes differently, changing the proportion of certain crimes to others. Also, differentiating the boundaries of a college town can be tricky, students live both on campus and around which can create a haziness between resident and student. Lastly, the data coming in annual reports poses the challenge of student population fluctuation, the crime rates and populations could be vastly different during school season as opposed to breaks like summer and winter. \n",

    "### IPEDS Dataset #1 (Enrollment Information) \n",
    "\n",
    "The EF2023-2024 dataset is from IPEDS (Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System) enrollment survey for Fall 2023. Each row represents a single instution identifiable by a unique UNITID. The columns EFLEVEL contains two digit codes representing enrollment categories for that row. For example, a value of 10 represents total enrollment across all levels of students, 20 represents total undergraduate enrollment, and 50 represents total graduate enrollment. These three enrollment categories will likely be the primary focus of our analysis. The main variable of interest is EFTOTAL, which represents the number of enrolled students for the specified category at each institution. This will serve as a proxy for institution size.\n",
    "\n",
    "One limitation is this datasets timing. The surey was conducted at the beginning of the 2023-2024 school year, meaning that it does not represent a full year's average. Because some of our other datasets reprepsent conditions from 2024, there is a slight misalignment in timing. Additionaly, this dataset doesn't account for students dropping out, transferring, or unenrolling later in the year. Essentially theres a very rare chance instutitonal shutdown or enrollment shifts could fruther lter the student population. Thus, the accuracy when correlating enrollment with variables such as crime rates or regional population might be impacted. Additionally, enrollment data is self-reported by institutions, and differences in how schools classify full-time and part-time students could introduce further inconsistencies. Finally, the dataset only includes institutions that participate in IPEDS surveys, meaning some  institutions may be omitted.\n",
    "\n",
    "### IPEDS Dataset #2 (Instution Metadata)\n",
    "\n",
    "The HD2023–2024 dataset is from IPEDS (Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System) and contains institutional level metadata for the 2023–2024 academic school year. Each row represents a single postsecondary institution and is uniquely identified by a UNITID. Key variables include INSTNM (institution name), ADDR (street address), CITY, STABBR (state abbreviation), ZIP (postal code), and COUNTYNM (county name). These variables describe where each institution is located and allow for geographic grouping or regional analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset will be used in conjunction with the EF2023–2024 enrollment dataset. By merging both datasets on the shared UNITID variable, we can combine institutional metadata with enrollment counts. This allows enrollment size (from EF2023–2024) to be linked with institutional locational characteristcs. We will likely analyze with different enrollment sizes assocaited with its zip code or city region.\n",
    "\n",
    "One limitation of the HD2023–2024 dataset is that it represents institutional characteristics at a specific point in time during the 2023–2024 academic year. Institutional attributes may change over time (for example, a school closing, merging, or changing classification), and these updates may not immediately reflect broader structural shifts. Additionally, as with other IPEDS data, the information is self-reported by institutions, which may introduce minor inconsistencies in how classifications are recorded. Finally, because IPEDS includes only institutions that participate in federal reporting, certain non-participating or very small institutions may be excluded. Despite these limitations, the dataset provides comprehensive institutional-level metadata that is essential for linking enrollment data to meaningful contextual variables.\n",
